    <!-- STORY -->
<div class="container">
    <p>Staten Island and The Bronx face inequalities in Mayor Bill DeBlasio’s Open Streets program. Both boroughs had almost 100,000 people per Open Streets program, compared to Manhattan’s 14,000 people per Open Streets.</p>

    <p>DeBlasio announced the NYC Open Street program in March to allow residents to use the city streets as recreational spaces during the pandemic. Barricades and signs were used to block roadways during certain times throughout the week to implement the program. The city chose what streets to use as open streets, but people could submit an application for a street of their own.</p>

    <p>“We're overlooked,” Reid, community organizer and event planner in The Bronx said. “[This is] something we definitely need and will support 100 percent.”</p>
