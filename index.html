    <!-- STORY -->
<div class="container">
    <p>Many Hunts Point natives say that the Boogie Down Grind Café is the central point of the community. However, the cozy venue lacked the space for a socially distant community-wide outdoor gathering the community needed during the pandemic, according to Hunts Point resident Oj Reid. </p>

    <p>Mayor Bill DeBlasio’s announced the NYC Open Street program in March to allow residents to use the city streets as recreational spaces. Barricades and signs are used to block roadways during certain times throughout the week to implement the program. The Bronx had the least Open Street programs in the city with 15 Open Streets programs, compared to the 121 programs in Manhattan. The Bronx is bigger than Manhattan in size and has about 200,000 less in population. </p>
